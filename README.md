## About
My_term is a C++ project that provides <short description of what the project does — e.g., a custom terminal emulator / terminal utilities / REPL>. It is implemented in modern C++ and built using a Makefile.

Replace this paragraph with a short, 1–2 sentence description of the project's purpose and core value.

---

## Features
- Feature 1 — <brief>
- Feature 2 — <brief>
- Feature 3 — <brief>

(Adjust or remove features as appropriate.)

---

## Requirements
- GNU Make
- A C++17-compatible compiler (g++ 7+ or clang++ 7+)
- POSIX-compatible system (Linux / macOS) — if the project uses OS-specific APIs, note that here
- Any additional libraries (e.g., ncurses, readline) — list them if the project depends on them

---

## Build / Install

Clone the repository and build with Make:

1. Clone:
   git clone https://github.com/rahulnoobcoder/My_term.git
   cd My_term

2. Build:
   make

3. Run:
   ./my_term
   (Replace ./my_term with the actual produced executable name if different.)

If Makefile defines different targets or expects environment variables, update these steps to match.

---

## Usage

Basic usage examples:

- Run interactively:
  ./my_term

- Run with arguments:
  ./my_term <arg1> <arg2>

- Example session:
  1. Start: ./my_term
  2. Do X: <example command>
  3. Exit: <exit command or Ctrl-D>

Add concrete examples and command-line flags/options here once known.

---

## Common Make targets

- make — build the default target (executable)
- make clean — remove build artifacts
- make run — build (if needed) then run the program (if defined)
- make test — run tests (if a test target exists)

Check the Makefile for exact targets and behavior.
